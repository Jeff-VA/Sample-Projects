## About Me

Currently, I am an MIS team specialist for a business-to-business IT Services and print management company. I love this role as I have a passion for exploring data and transforming it in novel ways to gain insight. From my experience of data maintenance and reporting in a fast-growing organization in tandem with achieving a Master of Science in Data Analytics degree, I am certain that my skillset will create value for a variety of business functions and data consumers wherever it is applied. I am genuinely excited to build and refine data analysis pipelines for data consumers and business stakeholders in my future career.

## Projects Overview

Thank you for taking the time to preview a few my data analysis sample projects. Below (highlighted in blue) are links to three separate projects that showcase the value of python for three different predictive analytics use cases. Each of the projects below show how Python code may be used to create insight with predictive and classification algorithms. Additionally, the `Prediction of US Forest Fires` project below demonstrates the capability of Python code to combine data from various sources. In a practical business sense, this approach may be used to combine data from an SQL database, a ServiceNow ticketing system, and a Salesforce customer relationship management system.

**Project 1: [Prediction of US Forest FIre Severity](forest_fire_project/overview.md)**
>This study showcases the application of a multiple linear regression analysis to attempt forest fire prediction with nearest weather station data in the United States.  

**Project 2: [Telecommunications Company Customer Churn Prediction](customer_churn_projecr/overview.md)**
>This analysis of hypothetical telecommunications data demonstrates how a logistic regression algorithm may be trained and tested to effectively predict customer attrition.

**Project 3: [Test Classification for Chatbot Intents](intent_text_classification/overview.md)**
>If a business with a high-volume ticketing system would like to use a conversationally capable chatbot to reduce agent time sink, this approach may be of significant value. With text classification, it is possible to train a chatbot to recognize certain categories of support in a high-volume ticketing system.
