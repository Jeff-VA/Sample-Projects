## About Me

Thank you for taking the time to preview a few of my data analysis sample projects. Currently, I am an MIS team specialist for a business-to-business IT Services and print management company. I love this role as I have a passion for exploring data and transforming it in novel ways to gain insight. From my experience of data maintenance and reporting in a fast-growing organization in tandem with achieving a Master of Science in Data Analytics degree, I am certain that my skillset will create value for a variety of business functions and data consumers wherever it is applied. I am genuinely excited to build and refine data analysis pipelines for data consumers and business stakeholders in my future career.

## Projects Overview

Below are links to three separate projects that showcase the value of python for different predictive analytics use cases. Each of the projects show how Python code may be used to create insight with predictive and classification algorithms.


**Project 1: [Telecommunications Company Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/Jeff-VA/Sample-Projects/blob/gh-pages/customer_churn_project/overview.md)**
>This analysis of hypothetical telecommunications data demonstrates how a logistic regression algorithm may be trained and tested to effectively predict customer attrition. [Click Here to view](https://github.com/Jeff-VA/Sample-Projects/blob/gh-pages/customer_churn_project/overview.md)


**Project 2: [Chatbot Intent Generation and Text Classification](https://github.com/Jeff-VA/Sample-Projects/blob/gh-pages/text_classification.ipynb)**
>If a business with a high-volume ticketing system would like to use a conversationally capable chatbot to reduce agent time sink, this approach may be of significant value. With text classification, it is possible to train a chatbot to recognize certain categories of support tickets.

**Project 3: [Prediction of US Forest FIre Severity](https://github.com/Jeff-VA/Sample-Projects/blob/gh-pages/forest_fire_project/overview.md)**
>This study showcases the application of a multiple linear regression analysis to attempt forest fire prediction with nearest weather station data in the United States. [Click Here to view](https://github.com/Jeff-VA/Sample-Projects/blob/gh-pages/forest_fire_project/overview.md)
